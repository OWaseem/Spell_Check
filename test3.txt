"Did LA give up too much to get a guy who has been labeled soft, although he puts up 19 and 9, which 11 other guys do?"

"Is that a trick question? They gave up Kwa-me Brown, who cares? I could care less! First of all, understand something. When you're giving up first round picks, if you are a quality team in playoff contention, it really doesn't mean that much, that's number one. Number two and more importantly, Kwame Brown is gone! The City of Angels, Hollywood should be celebrating. Throw a parade already whether you win a championship or not. This man was a bonafide scrub! He can't play! No disrespect whatsoever, but I'm sorry to call, tell everybody the truth, the man cannot play the game of basketball. He has small hands, he can't catch the ball, he has bad feet, he can't really move even though he's mobile, doesn't really know what he's doing, doesn't have a post move that he or he puts to memory that he can do two times in a row. He has no game whatsoever, plays no defense, doesn't have the heart, the passion or anything that comes with it, and you're asking me whether they gave up too much? Please. The Los Angeles Lakers knew exactly what they were doing, they should be celebrating right now, and Kobe Bryant should not be saying a word!"
